# AUV-simulation-for-underwater-pipeline-inspection
This project develops an AUV simulation for autonomous underwater pipeline inspection. To overcome the limitations of traditional methods, we used Minecraft for simulation, Roboflow for annotation, and integrated YOLOv8 for real-time corrosion detection, DeepSORT for object tracking, and HSV thresholding for pipeline segmentation.
